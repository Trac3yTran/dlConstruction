## **User Stories**

**The Owner**

![docs/adminIcon.png](docs/adminIcon.png)


The owner and his management team are hard workers that have brought the company great success in recent years.  Unfortunately, they lack the proper time to deal with employee paperwork, pay and communication. 

**As the owner, I want to:**

- View and approve all employee timesheets in one place so that I don't have to rifle through texts and emails.
- Receive the total work hours for each employee so I don't have to calculate it manually.
- I want to be able to distinguish between the work hours that have been paid, and those that are still pending.
- Create logins for new employees so that they can log their own hours.
- Delete logins when an employee leaves the company so that they no longer have access to the dashboard.
- Make announcements on the dashboard to allow all employees to be contacted so I don't have to contact them individually.

**The Client**

![docs/customerIcon.png](docs/customerIcon.png)


D & L Constructions clients live all across Sydney.  Anyone who is currently building in Sydney is a potential client, they have the time to shop-around and are constantly looking for the best work at the cheapest price.

**As a potential client, I want to:**

- Discover more about the business to gauge if the company holds a high standard of quality.
- Learn the range of services offered.
- See past projects so I know what my end product will look like.
- Contact the business to get a quote or ask a question.

**The Employee**

![docs/employeeIcon.png](docs/employeeIcon.png)


D & L Constructions have both employees and contractors. They are experienced tradespeople who's strengths have allowed them to succeed in a competitive industry.  However, their work is hard and once they've left the site the last thing they want to do is fill out more paperwork once they get home. 

**As an employee, I want to:**

- Submit a timesheet with minimal effort so I don't have to waste time once I'm already at home
- Know the status of my logged timesheets so that I can keep track of my finances.
- View any potential work that is on offer for full-time or contract positions.
